# TASK FOR QVANTO AI-TECHINCAL ROUND 1
The problem statement :
Metadata Catalog + Lineage + Claims Fraud workflow: Step 1: Build a searchable metadata catalog (CRUD with PII/regulatory tags, role-based access for data assets). Step 2: Map and visualize data lineage flows between policy → claim → models (graph UI). Bonus: Add a simple ML pipeline for claims fraud scoring and review dashboard. Deliver: Runnable app/code repo, with basic lineage graph & fraud stats dashboard. Scenario 2: Metadata Catalog & Data Lineage Tracker Build a simple metadata catalog with Create/Read/Update/Delete for insurance data assets (policy, claim, reserve model). Include PII or compliance tags. Support search/filter by tags or data types. Implement an interactive lineage visualization showing connections/pointers from policy → claim → reserve model results (basic graph or tree). Provide simple role-based access control for viewing vs editing metadata. (Bonus) Integrate a minimal fraud detection via a basic ML/rule model that scores claims as suspicious or OK. Provide a dashboard summarizing claim numbers and flagged fraud counts.
